# Eventstream
Android Based Photo Application

### Comp 490/491 Senior Design Project

Eventstream is a android app thats purpose to to create events for friends and family and have the ability to share photos
within that event. For example, say you create a wedding event and invite all your friends and family. They will be able to take
photos and share them directly to the event for everyone to see. Makes photo sharing much easier than asking everyone to send you their
pictures.
